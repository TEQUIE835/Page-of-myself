# Page-of-myself
A page proposed by Riwi and my TL to show my knowledge about html and css while showing my skills

# functionalities
## Navbar
I made a Navbar to see 3 different things, the home page, the profile that has my description and my projects and a contact button
## Home page or index
Here I have 2 things, a brief description and the contact formulary
- the brief description includes a photo and a button that lets you to the profile page
- the formulary only asks for name and email so I can contact you, for now it doesnt have real functionality

## profile
Here there are 2 other things, a larger description about myself and my projects
- in the description I put a photo of myself and also a description that includes the languages I know and will includes the ones I will learn
- In the projects there are the 3 projects that I'm proud of for now, it should include more in the future
